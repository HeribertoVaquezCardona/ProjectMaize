# Project Maize
This repo contains the scripts and the information to get the analyes of simpathry of maize (landraces and modern varities). 

Here we have 2 folders: bin and meta. Bin has the scripts to make the analyses. Meta has the procesed data and other files. 
But the scripts aren't ready to use.
